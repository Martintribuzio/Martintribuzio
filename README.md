## About Me 

I'm a 22-year-old junior fullstack web developer from Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, currently residing there. I just finished a Full Stack Developer Program at SoyHenry. I'm looking forward to working with sharp-minded people so we can tinker and create fascinating projects and push each other into improving ourselves, not only as people, but as developers as well. 

My goals are to expand my knowledge and work abroad to discover new cultures around the world.

TypeScript

## Backend
NodeJs</br>
Express</br>
PostgresSQL</br>
Sequelize

## Frontend
